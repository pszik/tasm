# Contributing to tasm

Contributors are most welcome to provide bug fixes or new features!

## Build setup

`tasm` is a standard IntelliJ IDEA project built with Gradle. It should be sufficient
to simply clone the repository and then open it as a project in IntelliJ.

## Testing

Tests are placed under `src/main/test` in the standard way.

## Submitting contributions

`tasm` operates a fork-and-pull model for contributions. To make your contributions,
fork the repository and do all your own work there. Once finished, you can then submit a
pull request for consideration.

## Submitting bugs and feature requests

Bugs and feature requests are contributed using Github's built-in issue tracking. Use
the templates provided to make them easy to understand!

## Code style

We follow [Google's Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html),
but with four-wide tabs. This should be automatically configured in the project files for you,
so just use IntelliJ's automatic formatter at regular intervals (`Alt+Shift+L` on Windows).
